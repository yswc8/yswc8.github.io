Offering a review on the courses I took at CMU.

! are the ones that are particularly time consuming for me.

### Fall 2023

**! 21-127 Concepts of Mathematics**: an introductory course that teaches proof and discrete math. Your experience in this class can vary greatly depending on the professor you have. In my case, the professor assigned hard exams and homework, and the median grades for the first two exams were in the 60s. Since I had no prior knowledge of proof-based math, I found the pace of the course to be quite challenging. The weekly problem sets, which consisted of 5-6 questions, usually took me around three days to complete. I heavily relied on office hours for assistance, but the TAs were overwhelmed with the number of students, so I often didn't get my questions answered and some concepts remained unclear. As a result, I made many fundamental logical errors and mistakes when attempting exam questions. I also experienced time constraints during the exams and was too anxious to complete the last question, which resulted in losing half of the marks. However, the final exam was more lenient with time, and I ended up doing much better than the previous tests. 
_(I spent around 17-20 hours every week on this class)_

**15-112 Fundamentals of programming and CS**: an introductory CS course that teaches some basic programming logic in python. I had already grasped most of the course concepts before taking it, but I still found the course to be engaging and rewarding. In my opinion, the course was extremely well-designed, and the TAs were incredibly supportive. My favourite part of the course was the term project, where I wrote around 1000 lines of code exploring some path-finding algorithms in maze generation. The project also made me appreciate many concepts that I had previously underestimated, such as object-oriented programming and top-down designs.
_(I spent around 6-10 hours every week on this class and around 15-18 hours during TP season)_

**03-151 Honors Modern Biology**: an honours version of an introductory biology class focusing on the molecular aspects of biology, mainly biochem and cellular biology. The class was pretty chill, but we covered a lot of material in depth, such as cytoskeleton and spindle movement. I enjoyed the level of detail we covered in biochemistry and it provided answers to many of the "why" questions I had in high school. Our professor was very knowledgeable in his field, and it was surprising to learn about many cutting-edge advancements in biology that even chat-gpt cannot recognise.
_(I spent around 4 hours every week if there are no exams and 6-8 hours cramming before each exam)_

**57-181 Solfege I**: an introductory solfege class. Fairly chill and did not require extra time after lectures. The core content was to identify musical intervals and dictate short melodies. Quite helpful in transcribing music in the future. I was planning to take it with Eurthymics I for a music minor, but didn't get off the waitlist for that class.
_(I spent around 2-3 hours every week only for the lectures)_

**38-101 Eureka: discovery & impact**: a compulsory class for me to take. Was OK. 
_(I spent around 3-4 hours every week only for the lectures)_

> Reflection: I only took 43 units this semester, which was supposed to help me adjust to college life easily. However, I found that Concepts was taking much more time than expected. Coming from a relatively chill high school that was much less competitive than CMU, I haven't established good study habits and struggled with this transition into college. Hopefully, next semester will be better.
