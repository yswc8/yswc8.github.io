Offering a review on the courses I took at CMU.

! are the ones that are particularly time consuming for me.

âœ° are the ones that are particularly worth taking.

## Sophomore Year

### Fall 2024 

- 36225 Introduction to Probability Theory

- 21241 Matrices and Linear Transformation

- 15150 Principles of Functional Programming 

- 36200 Reasoning with Data

- 67262 Database Design and Development 

- 99367 IDEATE: Pragmatic photography 

- 99358 IDEATE: Introduction to Unity and 3D Modelling


## Freshman Year

### Summer 2024

- **15-213 Introduction to Computer Systems**

- **99-270 Summer Undergraduate Research Apprenticeship**

### Spring 2024 

- **15-122 Principles of Imperative Computation**: a cs core that exposes you to data structures. Concepts such as linked lists and AVL rotations were interesting to learn, but not so much for the others. The labs were okay, with the last few challenging to debug in C and the OH queues for those were around 2-3 hours long. However, the exams were difficult. I experienced stressful time constraints in all of the exams and for the first exam, I left the last 3 pages blank. 
_(I spent around 13-15 hours every week)_ 

- **09-106 Modern Chemistry II**: a fairly easy chemistry core that covers thermo, kinetics, equilibrium, acids/bases... A few concepts such as pseudo rate law took a while to understand but the test questions were relatively formulaic. However, the weekly quizzes (sometimes twice a week) and the 8pm recitations were slightly annoying. Overall a chill class with generous grading.
_(I spent around 7 hours every week)_ 

- **73-102 Principles of Microeconomics**: an introductory microeconomics class that has a heavy focus on game theory and its application in the industries. The first 1/3 was extremely light as it overlaps with high school micro. The rest is mathy with a lot of calculations. I wouldn't classify it as the most engaging and easiest gen-ed, but it did not take up much time for me.
_(I spent around 5 hours every week)_ 

- **76-101 Intepretation and Arguments**: an extremely easy writing class. I never received such high scores in essays back in high school.
_(I spent around 4 hours every week)_ 

- **67-250 The Information Systems milieux**: a first year IS class that covers web dev (HTML/CSS, JS), SQL, and conceptual topics such as the business aspect of IS. It has a relatively moderate workload and requires consistent effort throughout the semester.
_(I spent around 9 hours every week)_ 

> Reflection: This semester was light with only 49 units. I declared a chemistry major on a computational chemistry track. Honetsly speaking, I didn't really enjoy any of the classes I took this semester and questioned a lot about my major choice and career goals. 

### Fall 2023

- **! 21-127 Concepts of Mathematics**: an introductory course that teaches proof and discrete math. My professor's median grades for the first two exams were in the 60s. Since I had no prior knowledge of proof-based math, I found the pace of the course to be quite challenging. The weekly problem sets, which only consisted of 5-6 questions, usually took me around three days to complete. I heavily relied on office hours for assistance, but the TAs were overwhelmed with the number of students, so I often didn't get my questions answered and some concepts remained unclear. I also experienced time constraints during the exams. However, the final was more lenient with time, and I ended up doing much better than the previous tests. 
_(I spent around 17-20 hours every week on this class)_

- **15-112 Fundamentals of programming and CS**: an introductory CS course that teaches some basic programming logic in python. I had already grasped most of the course concepts before taking it, but I still found the course to be engaging and rewarding. In my opinion, the course was extremely well-designed, and the TAs were incredibly supportive. My favourite part of the course was the term project, where I wrote around 1000 lines of code exploring some path-finding algorithms in maze generation. The project also made me appreciate many concepts that I had previously underestimated, such as object-oriented programming and top-down designs.
_(I spent around 6-10 hours every week on this class and around 15-18 hours during TP season)_

- **03-151 Honors Modern Biology**: an honours version of an introductory biology class focusing on the molecular aspects of biology, mainly biochem and cellular biology. The class was pretty chill, but we covered a lot of material in depth, such as cytoskeleton and spindle movement. I enjoyed the level of detail we covered in biochemistry and it provided answers to many of the "why" questions I had in high school. Our professor was very knowledgeable in his field, and it was surprising to learn about many cutting-edge advancements in biology that even chat-gpt cannot recognise.
_(I spent around 4 hours every week if there are no exams and 6-8 hours cramming before each exam)_

- **57-181 Solfege I**: an introductory solfege class. Fairly chill and did not require extra time after lectures. The core content was to identify musical intervals and dictate short melodies. Quite helpful in transcribing music in the future. I was planning to take it with Eurthymics I for a music minor, but didn't get off the waitlist for that class.
_(I spent around 2-3 hours every week only for the lectures)_

- **38-101 Eureka: discovery & impact**: a compulsory class for me to take. Was OK. 
_(I spent around 3-4 hours every week only for the lectures)_

> Reflection: I only took 43 units this semester, which was supposed to help me adjust to college life easily. However, I found that Concepts was taking much more time than expected. Coming from a relatively chill high school that was much less competitive than CMU, I haven't established good study habits and struggled with this transition into college. Hopefully, next semester will be better.
