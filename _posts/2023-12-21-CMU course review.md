Offering a review on the courses I took at CMU.

! are the ones that are particularly time consuming for me.

âœ° are the ones that are worth taking.

Freshman Year

Fall 2023

! 21127 Concepts of Mathematics: an introductory course that teaches mathematical proof and trains your logical reasoning skills. As someone who has never learnt anything related to proof-based math, I struggled a lot with this class. The weekly problem sets (with only 5-6 questions) usually took me around 3 days to complete and I heavily rely on office hours. The TAs were extremely helpful, but there were usually so many people in each OH so I don't usually get my question answered and some concepts clarified. This resulted in many fundamental logical errors and mistakes when I approach exam questions. I also found that I didn't have enough time during the each exam and loses a lot of marks in the last question since I was too anxious. That being said, the final exam is much more time lenient and I ended up doing much better than the previous tests. Unfortunately, I ended up performing quite average in this course, with a B mid-semester grade of B and also a B final grade.

03151 Honors Modern Biology:

> Reflection: I only took 43 units this semester, which was meant to help me transition into college life easily. However, concepts took much more time than expected since it was my first time approaching proof-based math and I was not getting a hang of everything. 

Pre-college credits: 21120 Calculus I, 21122 Calculus II, 09105 Modern Chemistry I
