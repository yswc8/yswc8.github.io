Offering a review on the courses I took at CMU.

! are the ones that are particularly time consuming for me.

âœ° are the ones that are worth taking.

### Fall 2023

**! 21127 Concepts of Mathematics**: an introductory course that teaches mathematical proof and trains your logical reasoning skills. Your experience in this class can vary greatly depending on the professor you have. In my case, the professor assigned hard exams and homework, and the median grades for the first two exams were in the 60s. Since I had no prior knowledge of proof-based math, I found the pace of the course to be quite challenging. The weekly problem sets, which consisted of 5-6 questions, usually took me around three days to complete. I heavily relied on office hours for assistance, but the TAs were overwhelmed with the number of students, so I often didn't get my questions answered and some concepts remained unclear. As a result, I made many fundamental logical errors and mistakes when attempting exam questions. I also experienced time constraints during the exams and was too anxious to complete the last question, which resulted in losing half of the marks. However, the final exam was more lenient with time, and I ended up doing much better than the previous tests. Overall, my performance in this course was fairly average, with a B grade mid-semester and a B final grade.
(I spent around 17-20 hours every week on this class)

**15112 Fundamentals of programming and CS**: an introductory CS course that teaches some basic programming logic in python. I had already grasped most of the course concepts before taking it, but I still found the course to be engaging and rewarding. In my opinion, the course was extremely well-designed, and the TAs were incredibly supportive. My favorite part of the course was the term project, where I explored and incorporated some path-finding algorithms in maze generation. The project also made me appreciate many concepts that I had previously underestimated, such as object-oriented programming and top-down designs.
(I spent around 6-10 hours every week on this class and around 15-18 hours during TP season)

**03151 Honors Modern Biology**: an honours version of an introductory biology class focusing on the molecular aspects of biology, mainly biochem and cellular biology. The class was pretty chill and we actually went in quite a lot of depth for some topics, such as cytoskeleton and spindle movement. In fact, I really enjoyed the in-depth coverage of biochemistry and found answers to many of the "why" questions that I had in high school. Our professor seemed quite knowledgeable in his field and it was surprising that we learnt many front-end advancements in biology that cannot be recognised even by chat-gpt. 
(I spent around 4 hours, including the 3h lectures, every week if there are no exams and 8-10 hours for cramming before each exam)

**57181 SOLFEGE I**: an introductory solfege class. Fairly chill and did not require extra time after lectures. The core content was to identify musical intervals and dictate musical melodies. Quite helpful in transcribing music in the future. I was planning to take it with Eurthymics I for a music minor, but didn't get off the waitlist for that class.
(I spent around 2-3 hours every week only for the lectures)

**Eureka: discovery & impact**: a compulsory class for me to take. Was OK. 
(I spent around 3 horus every week only for the lectures)

> Reflection: I only took 43 units this semester, which was supposed to help me adjust to college life easily. However, I found that Concepts was taking much more time than expected. Coming from a relatively chill high school that was much less competitive than CMU, I haven't established godo study habits and struggled with this transition into college. 

Pre-college credits using IB: 21120 Calculus I, 21122 Calculus II, 09105 Modern Chemistry I
